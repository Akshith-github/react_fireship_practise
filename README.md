## Create a React project by

1. install Node
2. check  the version of node using `node -v`
3. install create-react-app globally using npm with command: `npm install -g create-react-app`
4. navigate to your desired directory where you want
5. use command `npx create-react-app my-app` to  create a new react app named "my-app" in that directory

## Start Server by

1. change  into the newly created folder `cd my-app`
2. Run  server using command `npm start`. 
3. Go to page `http://localhost:3000/` to  see your application running live.




# Getting Started with React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
