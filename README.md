# Chapter 0 

## Create a React project by

1. install Node
2. check  the version of node using `node -v`
3. install create-react-app globally using npm with command: `npm install -g create-react-app`
4. navigate to your desired directory where you want
5. use command `npx create-react-app my-app` to  create a new react app named "my-app" in that directory

## Start Server by

1. change  into the newly created folder `cd my-app`
2. Run  server using command `npm start`. 
3. Go to page `http://localhost:3000/` to  see your application running live.

# Chapter 1 : React in 100 Seconds

React a js Library  released in 2013.

To build UI components that reperesent logical reusable  pieces of user interface.

**JSX** : is an extension to JavaScript language, used to write HTML elements and component structure inside JS files. 

Component can be built as easy as just by javascript function 

Return value from function is Html/UI written in JSX.

To pass input to component use props and reference in the jsx.

If value changes react will update component.

If we internal state, we use state hook.

Hook is fuction  which allows us to add some functionality to our functional component by returning a variable and function to change its value.

use `useState` from react to create a state hook. It returns an array containing current state and a function.


Reacts Extensions:

    1. Static Site : Gatsby
    2. Server  Side Rendering (SSR): NextJS 
    3. Animation : spring
    4. Form Handling : formik
    5. State Management: Redux, mobx,flux, recoil,xstate
    6. Mobile appilcations: React Native



# Appendix React DOCS : Getting Started with React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
